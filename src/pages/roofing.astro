          <h3 class="text-base font-bold text-global-blue mb-3">How soon do I need to file a roof damage claim with my insurance?</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Homeowners should file insurance claims as soon as possible after storm damage occurs—most policies have no formal deadline, but insurers expect prompt notice. Delaying weeks or months can complicate coverage decisions if the damage worsens or is questioned. Kentucky doesn't enforce a strict statutory deadline for homeowners to report roof damage, but your insurance contract likely requires prompt or timely notice.

          <h3 class="text-base font-bold text-global-blue mb-3">What affects the cost of a roof inspection or replacement?</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Roof replacement cost depends on roof size, material type, complexity, and local labor rates—typical replacements in Kentucky range from $8,000 to $25,000+. Inspections cost less and help determine whether repair or replacement is necessary. A professional roof inspection typically costs $250–$500 but can save thousands by catching problems early or by providing accurate documentation for insurance claims.
